Food for thought

Categories is an object of 
Key : List of todo objects

Ex:

Daily Life : [Todo OBJECT]

--

Todo objects contain
title, description, dueDate and priority

Title: name of todo
Description: default is ""
dueDate: uses date object?
priority: low, medium, high?

CLick on category card -> filter???

You should separate your application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules.
